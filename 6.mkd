Within the address range of each IPv4 network, we have three types of addresses:

* Network address - The address by which we refer to the network
* Broadcast address - A special address used to send data to all hosts in the network
* Host addresses - The addresses assigned to the end devices in the network

In an IPv4 network, the hosts can communicate one of three different ways:

* Unicast - the process of sending a packet from one host to an individual host
* Broadcast - the process of sending a packet from one host to all hosts in the network
* Multicast - the process of sending a packet from one host to a selected group of hosts

Broadcast types:
* The limited broadcast is used for communication that is limited to the hosts on the local network.
* A directed broadcast is sent to all hosts on a specific network.

# Ip adrres ranges:
 
* Host Addresses 0.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
* Multicast Addresses 224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.255
* Experimental Addresses 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255


# The private address blocks are:

* 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0 /8)
* 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0 /12)
* 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0 /16)

# Special ip addresses:
* Network and Broadcast Addresses
* Default Route(The use of this address also reserves all addresses in the 0.0.0.0 - 0.255.255.255 (0.0.0.0 /8) 
* Loopback
* Link-Local Addresses (IPv4 addresses in the address block 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255 (169.254.0.0 /16) are designated as link-local addresses.)
* TEST-NET Addresses The address block 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255 (192.0.2.0 /24) is set aside for teaching and learning purposes
